  In the cash journal of rainbow car wash, page 99, all debit columns are
at the left of the account title column and all credit columns are at the
right. Gift world's combination journal has twice the number of columns.
Therefore, the columns are arranged to make accurate recording and posting
easier. The debit and credit columns for cash, accounts receivable, and
accounts payable are arranged in pairs. This arrangement helps to avoid
errors in recording amounts in the wrong columns. Since the cash debit and
credit columns are used in almost every transaction, they are placed at the left
of the account title column. The remaining columns are placed at the right
of the account title column. The general debit and credit columns are placed
first. In this position, amounts for which special columns are not provided
will be close to the account titles written in the account title column.
  A memorandum entry for the beginning cash balance is recorded in the
combination journal at the beginning of each month. A similar entry was made
by rainbow car wash in its cash journal. The entry is recorded in the journal
so that the beginning cash balance is readily available for proving cash.
Since this entry is not posted, a check mark is placed in the Post. Ref.
column. The memorandum entry for gift world on november 1, 1977, is on line
1 of the combination journal, pages 174 and 175.
  The value of the goods a business purchases to resell to customers is
called the cost of merchandise. All costs of merchandise are deductions from
the revenue of the business. Therefore, the costs of merchandise are recorded
as debits. Costs of merchandise are kept in a separate division of the
general ledger. This is shown in the chart of accounts, page 170.
